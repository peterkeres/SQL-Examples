### Task 2 – Installation of software & Creation of SQLite file
In this task, we will install a software to use SQLite, DB Browser for SQLite. We may install SQLite and use SQLite to manipulate the database, but since it provides only command line interface and we have to learn commands to use the command line interface, we will use DB Browser for SQLite to use the GUI provided by DB Brower for SQLite.
